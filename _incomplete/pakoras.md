ingredients:
- 4 large onions, sliced
- 5 large potatoes, chopped into small thin pieces
- 250g baby spinach, chopped
- 1 large red pepper, chopped
- 1 tbsp ajwain
- 1 tbsp turmeric
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
- 0.5 tbsp garam masala
- 1kg gram flour
- Salt to taste
- Chopped green chilli or chilli powder to taste
- 2 litres vegetable oil

directions:
- Mix together the vegetables, spices and gram flour in a large bowl
- Leave to rest for 5 minutes. The mixture will continuously release  moisture and form a batter. Batter shouldn't be too runny or too thick.
- Heat oil on a medium heat while you wait
- If batter is too thick, let it rest for a little longer.
- If too runny, transfer part of the batter into a small bowl, gradually  add more gram flour in small amounts until desired consistency is  reached - fry this batch first. Repeat process until batter used up
- Gather a tablespoon or small handful worth of batter and gently place  in the oil. Turn occasionally to cook on both sides. Fry until golden  brown.
- Transfer bhajis into a  bowl lined with kitchen roll to soak up excess oil. Let them rest for a  few minutes and enjoy straight away with your favourite sauce or dip!
- And there we have it, beautiful bhajis!
